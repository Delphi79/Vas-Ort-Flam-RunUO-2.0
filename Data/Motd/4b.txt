Graphics
=======
Some of the monster graphics have been changed back to 2d

Loot Drops
=======
The Loot Pack has been updated to reflect this period of uo almost perfectly.

Monster Bash Arena
=======
The old Monster Bash Arena started off with 500 monsters, it will now start with 200 monsters.

World Spawn
=======
The world spawn and dungeon spawn will now reflect this period of uo better then in the past.

Some spawn was not implemented with the new super spawner system, we are tweaking these areas fear not.

Treasure chests will now be appearing in the dungeons for you hard core lockpickers.
