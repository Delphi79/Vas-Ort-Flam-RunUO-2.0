Combat
======
-Any player in Factions or Chaos/Order guild may no longer recall or use a moongate(public or cast) to flee combat.  This applies to attacking someone or even being attacked. This was applied to Chaos/Order due to the last fix that allowed Faction guilds to be Chaos/Order at the same time.
-Training room was fixed, pets shouldn't follow anyone through the moongate anymore.
-Instahit was removed by popular demand.

Misc
====
-The message gump for the command [on has been sexyfied.
-Some other small fixes for minor things that i forgot to write down :)
